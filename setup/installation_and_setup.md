# Installation and Setup Guide
I use VS Code as my editor for Java programs therefore it is necessory to configure in to execute the Java programs. 

## Steps
1. Download and install the latest JDK.
2. Add the Java "bin" folder's path to the System Environment Variables (under the "path" option available).
3. Add the "jdk-version_no." folder's path to a new System Environment Variable known as JAVA_HOME.
4. After the above steps go to VS Code and search for "tasks.json" and replace it with the code in this directory. 

## Execution in VS Code
1. Once the code is written just go to Terminal->Run Task.
2. Choose JC for Compiling the code and JR for Running the code.
